## About the Project

This project is a **Tic Tac Toe game** designed for two players (or player vs. computer in future versions). The game utilizes WPF for a clean user interface and C# for the backend logic. It also serves as a learning tool for understanding how to:

- Use grids and dynamic layouts in WPF.
- Handle user input and events.
- Implement game logic and state management.
